# SpeechToText
Uses the microphone to convert speech to text. It got me familiar with making GUIs for python. I used Kivy so I can put this on Android and IOS devices, but I haven't tried putting it on those devices yet.
It has a lot of libraries you need to download sadly, one of them that is hidden is PyAudio. I will probably improve on this later and make it into a virtual assistant like Amazon's Alexa.
This was a nice starting point of learning Speech to Text.
The computer will listen to you for the amount of seconds you input.
It saves the sentence that you said to a .txt file.
